1. What do you think is the runtime of a single append function call in cArray? Why?



2. What do you think is the runtime of a single append function call in cArray5? Why?



3. What do you think is the runtime of a single append function call in cList? Why?



4. Which of the two approaches in C do you think is actually used to implement the append function in Python? Why?


5. Python's lists also have an insert function, which inserts an element in the middle of the list. 
   Given the implementation you think is most likely, what do you believe would be the runtime of this insert function? 
   Why? Your explanation should say what operations would have to be performed on the array during an insert. 
   AFTER you've thought about these questions, replace the append line in pylist.py with array.insert(len(arra)//2).
